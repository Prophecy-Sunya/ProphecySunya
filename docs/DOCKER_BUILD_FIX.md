# Docker Build Process Fix

## Issue
Despite updating the Scarb.toml configuration to explicitly list all contract targets, the deployment still fails because the artifact file contains zero contracts:

```
Searching for prediction contract in 0 available contracts
```

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue is related to the Docker build process:

1. **Build Visibility**: The original Dockerfile doesn't provide enough visibility into the build process to diagnose issues
2. **Artifact Verification**: There's no verification that contract artifacts are actually being generated
3. **JSON Validation**: The artifact file structure isn't being validated before deployment

## Solution
The fix involves enhancing the Dockerfile.deployer with:

1. **Verbose Build Output**: Running `scarb build --verbose` to see detailed build information
2. **Artifact Inspection**: Adding explicit steps to list and examine all generated artifacts
3. **JSON Validation**: Using `jq` to validate and inspect JSON artifact files
4. **Debug Output**: Adding comprehensive debug output at each stage of the build and deployment

```dockerfile
# Debug: Show Scarb.toml content
RUN echo "Scarb.toml content:" && cat /app/Scarb.toml

# Build Cairo contracts with verbose output
RUN scarb --version && scarb build --verbose

# Debug: List all generated artifacts
RUN echo "Generated artifacts:" && \
    find /app/target -type f | sort && \
    echo "Artifact file contents:" && \
    find /app/target -name "*.json" -exec cat {} \; || echo "No JSON files found"
```

## Verification
The fix can be verified by:
1. Examining the Docker build logs to confirm contracts are being compiled
2. Checking the runtime container's `/app/target` directory for artifact files
3. Validating the JSON structure of the artifact files
4. Confirming the deployment script can find and deploy the contracts

## Best Practices for Docker Build Process
1. Always include verbose output for critical build steps
2. Add explicit verification steps for important artifacts
3. Use tools like `jq` to validate JSON files
4. Include comprehensive debug output in the CMD or ENTRYPOINT
5. Ensure all required files are properly copied between build stages

## Additional Recommendations
1. Add a pre-deployment validation step to verify artifact file structure
2. Consider adding a health check to confirm all required contracts are present
3. Implement a more robust error handling strategy for the deployment process
4. Add CI checks to validate the build process produces the expected artifacts
